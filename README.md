# terminalMemo2
Easily access to saved notes and commands by using this cli. Made for Windows (there are better options for UNIX). The personal commands and notes can be written to .cheat (txt) files. Then this cli provides easy and fast access to those notes and commands.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository

2. Download [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf). A binary file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases).

3. Add the repository location to environment variables, so you can directly call the findcmd script from command line. If you are using bash, then you can also create a bash alias to *.bashrc*
```bash
alias findcmd="C:/base/path/findcmd"
```


## Inspiration

If you are having a UNIX system, then you might want to concider installing navi. This Windows cli is just a result of navi not working on a Windows platform.
